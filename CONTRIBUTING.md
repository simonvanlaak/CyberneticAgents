# Contributing to CyberneticAgents

Thanks for taking an interest in **CyberneticAgents** — feedback and suggestions are genuinely welcome.

## TL;DR

- Please **do not open Pull Requests**.
- Instead, open a GitHub Issue as a **“Prompt Request”**.
- Describe the change you want in enough detail that I can implement it.

## Why no Pull Requests?

CyberneticAgents is being developed with a strong, opinionated architecture (VSM role boundaries, safety constraints, and a staged automation workflow). To keep the system coherent, I prefer to implement changes myself after reviewing how they fit the overall concept and vision.

## How to contribute (Prompt Request)

1) Open a new GitHub Issue
2) Prefix the title with:

> **Prompt Request:** <short title>

3) Include the following in the issue body:

- **What problem are you solving?**
- **Proposed change** (be concrete: file/section, exact wording, or pseudocode)
- **Success criteria** (what should be true after the change?)
- **How to test** (commands + expected result)
- **Constraints** (compatibility, performance, security, etc.)

### Great Prompt Requests include examples
If possible, add:
- a minimal reproduction
- sample inputs/outputs
- links to related issues/docs

## Security / Responsible disclosure

If you believe you found a security issue, please avoid posting sensitive details publicly.
Open an issue with a short description and ask for a private channel.
