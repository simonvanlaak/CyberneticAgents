# Tools

This directory contains the current tool surface used by the agents.

## Active tools

- `contact_user.py`: tools for asking the user questions or sending updates.
- `cli_executor/`: OpenClaw CLI executor and secret injection helpers.

## Notes

Legacy RBAC message-routing tools (delegate/escalate/system CRUD) were removed in favor
of the current OpenClaw integration and direct agent workflows.
