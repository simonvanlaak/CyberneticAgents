I still need to do deep dive into short term & long term memory to decide what would be a good plan here.

To look at:
There are already features provided by autogen.
The memory management of openclaw feels very smooth and non invasive, I should figure out how this is managed and copy what is useful.
There is also a need for a team & VSM wide knowledge database, but that might break the scope here.
